# Kara Logos

> Placeholder logos for the lazy developer

## About
In the past, I always saw myself trying to quickly mock up a logo to be used elsewhere. It was fun to come up with unique designs for each product I worked on. However, being a developer _first_, I quickly saw this process become a chore, rather than a fun indulgence, and looked forward to somehow _automate_ this process &mdash; automate is probably not the best word for it, though. That's when I decided to make [Kara Logos](https://kara.now.sh).

## Updates
I plan on adding new ones every now and then. The most updated version can be downloaded at [kara.now.sh](https://kara.now.sh). For every other release, please look at the [releases](https://github.com/21kb/kara.now.sh/releases) tab.

## Why the name Kara?
Because I was playing [Detroit: Become Human](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Detroit:_Become_Human) at the time and my favorite android in the game goes by the name of Kara.
